# New York Citi Bike Analysis

## Overview

Congratulations on your new role as the lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program! As the overseer of the largest bike-sharing program in the United States, you are responsible for generating regular reports for city officials looking to improve the program.

Since its inception in 2013, the Citi Bike program has amassed a wealth of data on its utilization. However, a robust dashboard or reporting process is yet to be implemented. This project aims to fill that gap by building a set of data reports to answer city officials' questions.

You can find my final Tableau Challenge results [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/crystal.rosenbrook/viz/TableauChallenge_16919735036830/TableauChallenge).

## Before You Begin

- Make sure to have a Tableau Public account.
- Due to Tableau's free-tier limitations, your work will be saved on their public server.
- You can continue working on the same workbook you've uploaded to Tableau Public.

## Data Sources

The data files for this project can be downloaded from the [Citi Bike Data webpage](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data). 

**Note**: Limit your download to 1-3 zip files to avoid issues with Tableau's 1GB file size restriction.

## Instructions

Your task is to aggregate data from the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and identify two unexpected phenomena. Create 4-10 total visualizations dedicated to these phenomena.

### Questions to Consider

- How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?
- What percentage has total ridership grown?
- What are the peak hours for bike usage in summer and winter?
- What stations are popular for starting and ending journeys?
- How does the average trip duration vary by user type?

## Considerations

Your audience includes city officials, public administrators, and heads of New York City municipal departments. Make sure your presentation is professional, focused, and visually appealing.

## Requirements

- **Map**: Markers for all bike stations, with visual indications of popularity.
- **Visualizations**: 4-10 total visualizations.
- **Tableau Story**: An informative and easy-to-navigate Tableau story.
- **Analysis**: Written in a markdown file or included in the Tableau Public workbook.
